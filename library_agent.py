    def _handle_unknown(self) -> str:
        """Handle unknown queries."""
        return """
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

Try asking things like:
  • "What books are available?"
  • "What books did Alice Chan borrow?"
  • "Show all students"
  • "Library stats"

Type 'help' for more options.
